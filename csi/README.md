## About

This crate contains CSI protocol implementation: the node part (mayastor-csi)
and the control plane part (moac) written in node-js. The rest of the doc
is about the mayastor-csi. It is an asynchronous server implementation making
use of tokio.rs.

The mayastor-csi plugin implements two gRPC services:

* identity CSI service
* node CSI service

See [grpc proto file](../rpc/proto/mayastor.proto) for the details of the gRPC
interface.

## Building and running the gRPC server

After `cargo build` the binary will be in `target/debug` directory.
To get a debug output just from the server and not other libraries (i.e.
tokio, tower-grpc, etc.), run it as follows:

```bash
RUST_LOG=mayastor_grpc=trace ./target/debug/mayastor-csi
```

# CSI

CSI methods can be tested by official csc tool written in golang. Assuming that golang
is installed and GOPATH set, csc tool can be installed as:

```bash
go get github.com/rexray/gocsi && make -C $GOPATH/src/github.com/rexray/gocsi csi-sp
```

Now assuming that mayastor-client server is running and for example we want to
invoke a probe method from csi identity service, we can type:

```bash
$GOPATH/src/github.com/rexray/gocsi/csc/csc -i -e unix:///var/tmp/csi.sock identity probe
```
